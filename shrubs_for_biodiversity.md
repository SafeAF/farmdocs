# Shrubberies on Working Land
*A practical guide to edge ecology, biodiversity, and restraint*

---

## Purpose

This guide documents a **controlled, ecological approach to shrub establishment** on working agricultural land.

Goals:
- Increase biodiversity without reducing hay quality
- Build resilient edge ecosystems
- Favor **slow, clonal spread** over aggressive seeding
- Avoid species that escape, dominate, or create long-term control problems
- Integrate **human use**, **livestock safety**, and **wildlife function**

This is not ornamental landscaping.  
This is **ecological infrastructure**.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Edges matter more than interiors**
   - All shrub systems live along fence lines, headlands, slopes, and buffers
   - Pasture interiors remain production-focused

2. **Spread at human speed**
   - Favor species propagated by:
     - Hardwood cuttings
     - Softwood cuttings
     - Layering
     - Division
   - Avoid heavy seeders and runner-dominant plants

3. **Vertical structure drives biodiversity**
   - Shrubs create:
     - Nesting habitat
     - Wind breaks
     - Shade gradients
     - Insect scaffolding
   - Flowers and grasses follow structure, not the other way around

4. **Occasional disturbance is healthy**
   - Coppicing, pruning, mowing edges
   - Prevents dominance
   - Encourages regeneration

## Moisture Zonation (Critical)

The land slopes and includes:
- Dry uplands
- Overspray zones
- Runoff-affected low spots

Shrubs must be matched to moisture regime.

## Shrub Species by Zone

---

### DRY to AVERAGE MOISTURE
*(slopes, fence lines, no irrigation)*

#### Serviceberry (*Amelanchier spp.*)
- **Human edible:** Yes (sweet berries)
- **Livestock safety:** Safe
- **Forage value:** Minor browse
- **Propagation:** Semi-hardwood cuttings, suckers
- **Behavior:** Non-invasive, deep-rooted

**Notes:** One of the best dual-use shrubs available.

---

#### Native Wild Rose (*Rosa woodsii* or similar)
- **Human edible:** Rose hips
- **Livestock safety:** Safe
- **Forage value:** Minimal (thorn-limited)
- **Propagation:** Hardwood cuttings, layering
- **Behavior:** Slow spread, easy to confine

**Notes:** Bird nesting fortress.

---

#### Rabbitbrush (*Ericameria / Chrysothamnus*)
- **Human edible:** No
- **Livestock safety:** Safe
- **Forage value:** Low, emergency browse
- **Propagation:** Hardwood cuttings
- **Behavior:** Extremely drought tolerant

**Notes:** Critical late-season pollinator plant.

---

#### Snowberry (*Symphoricarpos*)
- **Human edible:** No (toxic)
- **Livestock safety:** Generally safe
- **Forage value:** Minor
- **Propagation:** Division, layering
- **Behavior:** Low thicket former

**Notes:** Structural shrub, winter wildlife value.

---

### WET to MOIST ZONES
*(overspray, runoff, low areas)*

#### Red-Osier Dogwood (*Cornus sericea*)
- **Human edible:** No
- **Livestock safety:** Safe
- **Forage value:** Yes (young shoots)
- **Propagation:** Extremely easy hardwood cuttings
- **Behavior:** Responds well to coppicing

**Notes:** Outstanding erosion control and insect support.

---

#### Elderberry (*Sambucus spp.*)
- **Human edible:** Yes (berries cooked)
- **Livestock safety:** Caution (leaves/stems mildly toxic)
- **Forage value:** None
- **Propagation:** Hardwood and softwood cuttings
- **Behavior:** Large, fast establishment

**Notes:** Keep outside grazing pressure.

---

#### Shrub Willows (*Salix spp.*, shrub forms)
- **Human edible:** No
- **Livestock safety:** Safe
- **Forage value:** **High**
- **Propagation:** Stick cuttings directly in soil
- **Behavior:** Requires periodic coppicing

**Notes:** One of the few shrubs that meaningfully feeds livestock.

---

### BONUS: Nitrogen-Fixing Shrub

#### Buffaloberry (*Shepherdia spp.*)
- **Human edible:** Yes (tart berries)
- **Livestock safety:** Safe
- **Forage value:** Limited
- **Propagation:** Hardwood cuttings
- **Behavior:** Slow-growing, thorny

**Notes:** Excellent ecological hedge species.

---

## Species to Avoid (High Regret Potential)

- Russian olive
- Non-native honeysuckle
- Privet
- Aggressive buckthorn
- “Fast-growing” screen plants
- Purchased insect egg cases (mantids, etc.)

Fast establishment usually means **fast escape**.

---

## Livestock Interaction Summary

Shrubs are **not pasture**.

They provide:
- Edge browse
- Emergency forage
- Shade and shelter
- Predator habitat

Primary livestock feed remains hay and pasture grasses.

## Edible Fruit Summary

| Shrub | Human Edible | Notes |
|-----|-------------|------|
| Serviceberry | Yes | Fresh or dried |
| Elderberry | Yes | Must be cooked |
| Chokecherry | Yes | Processed only |
| Buffaloberry | Yes | Best after frost |
| Wild Rose | Yes | Rose hips |

---

## Establishment Strategy

### Year 1
- Plant shrubs only
- Mulch heavily (wood chips ideal)
- Water first season as needed

### Year 2
- Light pruning or coppicing
- Observe spread and survival
- Begin adding native forbs

### Year 3+
- Minimal intervention
- Edge mowing for control
- Trail development and signage

---

## Integration With Hay Production

- Interior pasture remains production-focused
- Fence lines and buffers are **never hayed**
- Occasional full-season rest improves:
  - Root reserves
  - Seed bank
  - Soil biology

Ecology and premium hay are not opposites.

---

## Philosophy

> Shrubs are not decoration.  
> They are **habitat, buffer, resilience, and memory**.

A working landscape can:
- Produce income
- Support wildlife
- Teach visitors
- Improve itself over time

Edges are where that happens.
